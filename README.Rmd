# simpar

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of simpar is to create parameters for simulation with uncertainty.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("metrumresearchgroup/simpar")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to do a basic simulation:

```{r example}
library(simpar)
theta <- c(1,2,3)/10
covar <- diag(0.1, 3)
omega <- matrix(1)
sigma <- matrix(0.025)
simpar(10, theta, covar, omega, sigma, odf = 100, sdf = 1000)
```
